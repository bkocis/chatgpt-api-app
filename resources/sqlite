Give piece of code that add functionality to store the chat sessions, the questions and the answers in a sqlite3 database.

To add functionality to store the chat sessions, questions, and answers in a sqlite3 database,
you can use the sqlite3 module in Python.
Here's an example of how you can modify the message_handler function to save the chat sessions:

import sqlite3

# ...

# create a connection to the sqlite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('chat_sessions.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# create a table to store the chat sessions
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chat_sessions
             (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              question TEXT,
              answer TEXT)''')
conn.commit()

def message_handler(
    chat: Optional[ChatOpenAI],
    message: str,
    chatbot_messages: ChatHistory,
    messages: List[BaseMessage]
) -> Tuple[ChatOpenAI, str, ChatHistory, List[BaseMessage]]:
    # ...

    # save the question and answer to the database
    c.execute("INSERT INTO chat_sessions (question, answer) VALUES (?, ?)", (message, content))
    conn.commit()

    # ...

    return chat, "", chatbot_messages, messages

This will create a new database file called chat_sessions.db in the same directory as your script,
and create a table called chat_sessions.
Each time the message_handler function is called, it will insert the question and answer into the chat_sessions table.
You can modify the table schema to include additional columns if needed.
